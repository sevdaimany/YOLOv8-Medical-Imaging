# YOLOv8 Medical Imaging

YOLO is known for its ability to detect objects in an image in a single pass, making it a highly efficient and accurate object detection algorithm.🎯

The latest version of YOLO, YOLOv8, released in January 2023 by Ultralytics, has introduced several modifications that have further improved its performance.

In this project, I will focus on three major computer vision tasks that YOLOv8 can be used for: **classification**, **detection**, and **segmentation**. I will explore how YOLOv8 can be applied in the 
field of medical imaging to detect and classify various anomalies and diseases🧪💊.


## Introduction to YOLOv8
Some of the notable modifications in YOLOv8 include:

- **New Backbone Network**: YOLOv8 adopts the powerful Darknet-53 as its backbone network, enhancing feature extraction capabilities.

- **Anchor-Free Detection**: YOLOv8 employs an anchor-free detection head, which directly predicts the center of an object instead of relying on offset values from predefined anchor boxes.

- **New Loss Function**

## Tasks

In this project, I focus on three major computer vision tasks using YOLOv8, all accessible through the Streamlit web application:

1. **Classification:** Utilize the YOLOv8 model to classify medical images into three categories: COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, and Normal, using the [COVID-19 Image 
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset).

2. **Object Detection:** Employ YOLOv8 for detecting Red Blood Cells (RBC), White Blood Cells (WBC), and Platelets in blood cell images using the [RBC and WBC Blood Cells Detection 
Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/tfg-2nmge/yolo-yejbs).

3. **Segmentation:** Use YOLOv8 for segmenting breast ultrasound images with the [Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset).

## Screenshots

I used Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the YOLOv8 model. Below are screenshots of each part:

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sevdaimany/YOLOv8-Medical-Imaging.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd YOLOv8-Medical-Imaging
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

   ```bash
venv\Scripts\activate

   ```

On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
source venv/bin/activate

   ```
5. Install the required dependencies from the provided requirements.txt file:


   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage
**Using the Provided Demo Images**

I've made it easy for you to get started with our project without the need to download a dataset. I've included a set of demo images in the DEMO_IMAGES directory. You can use these images to quickly see 
how our project works.

**Run the Streamlit App:**

Start the Streamlit app to see our project in action:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
